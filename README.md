I liked all the `z-index` stuff going on in this challenge, but as a result, I had a difficult time making it responsive. There's a ton of over-styling, and it's still not perfect. I think if I were to do it over, I might set two BG images for the photo div?

The slider definitely complicates things. I couldn't find a good way to set the BG image in the CSS with Javascript, so I had to set the BG image inline in the `photo` div and use JS to change that. My JS slider solution is kind of crude, but it works. Overall, this is a challenge I'd like to come back to when I have a little more experience...I think I've been staring at it too long!
